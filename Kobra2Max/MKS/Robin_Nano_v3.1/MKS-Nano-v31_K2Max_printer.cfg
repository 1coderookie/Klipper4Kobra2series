# This file contains common pin mappings for MKS Robin Nano V3
# boards. To use this config, the firmware should be compiled for the
# stm32f407. When running "make menuconfig", select the 48KiB
# bootloader, and enable "USB for communication".

# The "make flash" command does not work on the MKS Robin. Instead,
# after running "make", copy the generated "out/klipper.bin" file to a
# file named "Robin_nano_v3.bin" on an SD card and then restart the
# MKS Robin with that SD card.

# See docs/Config_Reference.md for a description of parameters.

# ATTENTION:
# - This configuration is WIP!

# NOTES:  
#
# This configuration is for the MKS Robin Nano v3.1 as a replacement for the stock mainboard of an Anycubic Kobra 2 Pro/Plus/Max. 
# Initially, the settings were for a *Kobra 2 PRO*, but I tried to adjust as many settings for the K2 MAX already as possible - but please still check yourself!   
# Please mind the comments I added for certain settings.  
#
# For tipps and instructions about how to proceed when installing an MKS Robin Nano v3.1 in a K2 Pro/Plus/Max, please see my comprehensive and model-specific infosites:

#points:
#   A list of X, Y coordinates (one per line; subsequent lines

#   Specify coordinates of the nozzle and be sure the probe is above
#   the bed at the given nozzle coordinates. This parameter must be

#   minimum value for the range of probed points which you can learn
#   by observing command output.

#[screws_tilt_adjust]  
# If you're using adjustable spacers for being able to manually tram the bed, configure [screws_tilt_adjust] which helps you tramming the bed. Please see Klipper's documentation for further info.
#screw1:  # The (X, Y) coordinate of the first bed leveling screw. This is a position to command the nozzle to so that the probe is directly above the bed screw (or as close as possible while still being above the bed). This is the base screw used in calculations. This parameter must be provided.

#screw2:
#screw2_name:
#... 
#   Additional bed leveling screws. At least two screws must be defined.
#speed: 50  # The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the calibration. The default is 50.
#horizontal_move_z: 5  # The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5. 
#screw_thread: CW-M3  # The type of screw used for bed leveling, M3, M4, or M5, and the rotation direction of the knob that is used to level the bed. Accepted values: CW-M3, CCW-M3, CW-M4, CCW-M4, CW-M5, CCW-M5. Default value is CW-M3 which most printers use. A clockwise rotation of the knob decreases the gap between the nozzle and the bed. Conversely, a counter-clockwise rotation increases the gap.


# [axis_twist_compensation]  
# Compensates a twisted X-axis gantry. Shouldn't be necessary, but you might want to check for it and use it.

# horizontal_move_z: 5  # The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
# calibrate_start_x: 20 # Defines the minimum X coordinate of the calibration. This should be the X coordinate that positions the nozzle at the starting calibration position. This parameter must be provided.
# calibrate_end_x: 210  # Defines the maximum X coordinate of the calibration. This should be the X coordinate that positions the nozzle at the ending calibration position. This parameter must be provided.

accel_per_hz : 75.0 # This parameter is used to determine which acceleration to use to test a specific frequency: accel = accel_per_hz * freq. Higher the value, the higher is the energy of the oscillations. Can be set to a lower than the default value if the resonances get too strong on the printer. However, lower values make measurements of high-frequency resonances less precise. The default value is 75 (mm/sec).
hz_per_sec : 1.0 # Determines the speed of the test. When testing all frequencies in range [min_freq, max_freq], each second the frequency increases by hz_per_sec. Small values make the test slow, and the large values will decrease the precision of the test. The default value is 1.0 (Hz/sec == sec^-2).
max_smoothing : 0.05  # Maximum input shaper smoothing to allow for each axis during shaper auto-calibration (with 'SHAPER_CALIBRATE' command). By default no maximum smoothing is specified. Refer to Measuring_Resonances guide for more details on using this feature.

# NOTE:
# In the following, the bus and pin assignments for both accel chips are set. 
# I wired up both sensors to the same MOSI, MISO, SCLK of the EXP2 connector, which is SPI1. 
# Attention: CS pins HAVE to be connected to different pins!  
# Accel sensor needs 5V VCC - you can take that from either EXP1 or the BLtouch connector.
# If you need that EXP2 connector for an optional screen, you can try using the free socket for the WiFi module which is SPI2 then - see comments. 
# If that doesn't work and you don't need the 5th stepper driver E1 for driving a 2nd z-axis motor independently, you can also use that one - make sure to set the jumper for SPI mode then!
