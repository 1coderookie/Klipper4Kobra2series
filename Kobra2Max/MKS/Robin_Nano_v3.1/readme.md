This `printer.cfg` file is made to fit the installation and pin assignments of my MKS Robin Nano v3.1 mod - please see the following section of my comprehensive [Kobra2Max Insights](https://1coderookie.github.io/Kobra2MaxInsights/) infosite for further information: [MOD: MKS Robin Nano v3.1](https://1coderookie.github.io/Kobra2MaxInsights/hardware/mainboard/#mod-mks-robin-nano-v31)

**ATTENTION**  
The settings in the file `MKS-Nano-v31_K2Max_printer.cfg` are based on my initial settings for my Kobra 2 Pro, I adjusted them to the best of my knowledge to suit the MAX.
